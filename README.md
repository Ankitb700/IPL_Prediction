# IPL Prediction
IPL Prediction is a project aimed at predicting the outcomes of cricket matches in the Indian Premier League (IPL) using machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques. The project leverages historical match data, player statistics, team performance metrics, and other relevant features to make predictions about upcoming matches in the tournament.

# Introduction
The IPL Prediction project utilizes various machine learning models and statistical techniques to analyze historical IPL match data and make predictions about future matches. The project aims to provide cricket enthusiasts, sports analysts, and betting enthusiasts with insights into the potential outcomes of IPL matches based on historical trends and performance metrics.

# Technologies Used
**Python:** The project is implemented in Python, a versatile programming language commonly used for machine learning, data analysis, and web development.

**Pandas:** Pandas is a data manipulation and analysis library in Python used for processing and analyzing match data, player statistics, and other relevant datasets.

**Scikit-learn:** Scikit-learn is a machine learning library in Python used for building and training predictive models. I used logistic Regression.

**Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Matplotlib and Seaborn are plotting libraries in Python used for creating visualizations such as line plots, bar plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

**Streamlit:** Streamlit is a Python library used to create interactive web applications for data analysis and visualization. It can be used to create a user-friendly interface for users to input match data and view prediction results.

Data Sources
The IPL Prediction project relies on the following data sources:

IPL Match Data: Historical data of IPL matches, including match results, venue, date, and team compositions.
Player Statistics: Performance statistics of individual players, including batting averages, bowling averages, strike rates, etc.
Team Performance Metrics: Team-level performance metrics such as win-loss ratios, run rates, net run rates, etc.
Model Building
The IPL Prediction project involves the following steps for model building:

Data Collection: Gather historical match data, player statistics, and team performance metrics from reliable sources such as official IPL websites, cricket databases, and APIs.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature engineering.
Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for predicting match outcomes, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting algorithms like XGBoost.
Model Training: Train the selected models on historical match data using techniques like cross-validation to evaluate performance and prevent overfitting.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
Prediction: Use the trained models to make predictions about upcoming IPL matches based on input features such as team compositions, venue, and player statistics.
Usage
To use the IPL Prediction project:

Input historical match data, player statistics, and relevant features into the system.
Train machine learning models on the input data to learn patterns and relationships.
Use the trained models to make predictions about upcoming IPL matches based on input features.
Evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the predictions using appropriate evaluation metrics.
Optionally, deploy the prediction model as a web application using Streamlit for real-time predictions and user interaction.

## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  streamlit app.run
```


## Run Locally

Sample code

```bash
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load IPL match data into a DataFrame
ipl_data = pd.read_csv("ipl_match_data.csv")

# Preprocess the data, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a random forest classifier on the training data
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing data
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the accuracy of the predictions
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)


```
